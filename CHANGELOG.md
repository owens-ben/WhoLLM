# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Device-based room presence.** A phone, watch or tag entity assigned to a person or pet that reports a room (Bermuda area sensors, ESPresense, room-assistant, or an `area`/`room` attribute) now places them in that room directly, without asking the LLM. Room names are matched ignoring case, spaces and dashes; an unmatched room is logged once as a warning.
- `sensor.{room}_occupants` for each room: the number of people in it, with `people`, `pets`, `confidence` and `sources` attributes.
- `source` attribute on `sensor.{name}_room` (`device_room`, `device_tracker` or `llm`).

### Changed
- **Confidence scores are higher and mean more.** The confidence combiner now combines agreeing signals instead of dividing their sum by 2.60, so motion plus the AI scores 0.74 instead of 0.37, and conflicting rooms lower the winner's confidence. Raise any `confidence` thresholds you lowered to cope with the old values (`0.6` to `0.7` is a good start). See the Accuracy & limits docs.
- The Ollama prompt now asks the model for a `CONFIDENCE:` value; `CONFIDENCE: 85` and `85%` are read as 0.85.
- **BREAKING (blueprints):** Welcome Home Lights and Goodbye Routine trigger on the room sensor changing from or to `away` instead of the `roomer_person_arrived` / `roomer_person_left` events. Goodbye Routine takes a list of room sensors and runs only once all of them are still `away` after the delay. Re-create automations made from it.
- Follow Me Music's default minimum confidence is now 0.7.

### Fixed
- A device tracker whose state is a room name is no longer treated as "not home".
- Habits were rarely learned, because correct answers almost never reached the 0.7 learning threshold.
- The confidence combiner's "multiple signals agree" bonus could never apply.
- Blueprints used `!input` inside templates without a `variables:` block, so their template conditions (room, confidence, optional inputs) never worked.
- Goodbye Routine stopped at the first optional input left empty (for example no lights), and failed validation when lights, locks, climate or alarm were left empty.
- Welcome Home Lights' "only after dark" check could never pass (`after: sunset` and `before: sunrise` in one condition); it now uses `sun.sun` being below the horizon.
- `automations/vision_on_motion.yaml` referenced `sensor.llm_vision_last_identification`; it is `sensor.vision_last_identification`.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-10-21

The redesign release: a new look across the dashboard card, the standalone dashboard, the docs site and the README.

### Added
- New logo: a house of four rooms, with the occupied rooms lit and a person in each. Includes an SVG favicon.
- Docs site theme with light and dark modes, Bricolage Grotesque headings and DM Sans text.
- README banner that follows the reader's light or dark GitHub theme.
- Dashboard card `theme` option (`auto`, `light` or `dark`). `auto` follows Home Assistant's dark mode.

### Changed
- New colour palette: a warm oat base with Denim as the main colour, olive-sage and marigold accents, and a neutral charcoal dark mode.
- Dashboard card redesigned: a row per person with their room, the strongest clues, and a confidence chip in words and numbers ("Sure · 91%"). Avatars use the person's Home Assistant picture, or initials when there is none. People who are away are shown with a dashed outline.
- Standalone dashboard restyled to match.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-21

### Added
- Documentation site (MkDocs Material, deployed to GitHub Pages).
- Services `roomer.refresh`, `roomer.correct_room`, `roomer.get_history`, `roomer.clear_history` and `roomer.get_patterns` are now registered.
- `roomer_room_changed`, `roomer_person_arrived` and `roomer_person_left` events now fire.
- Test suite with pytest and a CI workflow for Python 3.11–3.13.
- `pyproject.toml` and Ruff linting configuration.

### Changed
- The project is now called Roomer (domain `roomer`).
- Docs lead with the problem (who is in which room, from combined weak signals) rather than the LLM. An LLM provider is still required.
- Removed emojis from indicator strings in provider code.

### Fixed
- Learned habits and history are saved when Home Assistant stops, instead of being lost on restart.
- `services.py` imported functions that no longer existed, so the module failed to load.
- Home Assistant 2025.x compatibility: use direct import for `async_track_time_interval` instead of deprecated `hass.helpers.event` access.

## [0.1.0-alpha] - 2025-01-29

### Added
- Initial release
- LLM-based presence detection using Ollama
- Multi-person and pet tracking
- Configurable room-entity mappings via UI
- Person-device ownership mappings (e.g., assign a PC to a person)
- Confidence combining from multiple signal sources:
  - LLM reasoning
  - Sensor indicators (motion, media, computers, cameras)
  - Learned habit patterns
- Fallback chain when LLM is unavailable
- Habit learning system that learns patterns over time (no hardcoded defaults)
- Vision identification service using Ollama vision models
- Event logging for ML training data collection
- Storage cleanup service with configurable retention
- CrewAI provider support (experimental)

### Providers
- **Ollama**: Primary provider, runs locally
- **CrewAI**: Experimental support for Claude-based reasoning

### Entities Created
- `sensor.{name}_room` - Current room for each person/pet
- `binary_sensor.{name}_in_{room}` - Per-room presence binary sensors
- `sensor.vision_last_identification` - Last vision identification result

### Services
- `roomer.identify_person` - Trigger vision identification from a camera
- `roomer.enable_tracking` / `roomer.disable_tracking` - Camera tracking control
- `roomer.cleanup_storage` - Manual storage cleanup
