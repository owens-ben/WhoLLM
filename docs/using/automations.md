# Automations

Roomer's entities work like any other Home Assistant sensor, so you can use them in normal automations. This page covers the blueprints that ship with Roomer and some copy-paste examples.

!!! tip "Which entity should I trigger on?"
    - **"Alice walks into the office"** → `binary_sensor.alice_in_office` turning `on`.
    - **"Alice moved rooms"** or **"Alice left / got home"** → a state change of `sensor.alice_room`.

    See [Entities](entities.md) for the full list.

## Before you start: avoid flicker

Roomer re-checks every person every few seconds (10 by default), and the answer can briefly change when signals are close. Most automations should wait until a new room has held for a short time before acting. Add a `for:` to the trigger:

```yaml
trigger:
  - platform: state
    entity_id: binary_sensor.alice_in_office
    to: "on"
    for: "00:00:30"   # must stay "on" for 30 seconds
```

If you add a `confidence` condition, `0.7` is a good starting point: it passes when at least a motion sensor and the AI agree, or when one strong signal (camera, TV, the person's own PC) points at the room. Values around 0.5 mean the evidence is thin or split between rooms. Check the actual values in your home before going higher. [Accuracy & limits](accuracy.md) explains how the number is worked out.

## How to add these examples

The examples are written in YAML.

1. Go to **Settings → Automations & scenes → Create automation → Create new automation**.
2. Open the **⋮** menu (top right) and choose **Edit in YAML**.
3. Replace the contents with the example, change the entity IDs to yours, and save.

The examples use the long-standing `trigger:` / `platform:` / `service:` keys, which work on every Home Assistant version Roomer supports. Newer versions will convert them to `triggers:` / `actions:` when you save. That's expected.

## Example 1: office lights on when Alice walks in

```yaml
alias: "Office lights on when Alice arrives"
description: "Turn on the office lights when Roomer puts Alice in the office"
mode: single
trigger:
  - platform: state
    entity_id: binary_sensor.alice_in_office
    to: "on"
    for: "00:00:20"
condition:
  - condition: state
    entity_id: light.office
    state: "off"
action:
  - service: light.turn_on
    target:
      entity_id: light.office
    data:
      brightness_pct: 80
```

To turn the lights off again when she leaves, trigger on the same binary sensor going `off`. Use a longer `for:`, such as five minutes, so a quick trip to the kitchen doesn't plunge the room into darkness:

```yaml
alias: "Office lights off when Alice leaves"
mode: restart
trigger:
  - platform: state
    entity_id: binary_sensor.alice_in_office
    to: "off"
    for: "00:05:00"
action:
  - service: light.turn_off
    target:
      entity_id: light.office
```

!!! warning "A light can keep itself on"
    If `light.office` is also mapped to the office in Roomer, the light being on counts as a sign that someone is in the office. Turning lights on from Roomer and then using those same lights as evidence can keep a person "stuck" in a room. Prefer motion sensors, PCs and media players as the office's signals, or keep a long `for:` on the "off" automation.

## Example 2: notify when someone gets home

This sends a phone notification when Alice's room changes from `away` to any room in the house. It uses the room sensor, so it needs a device tracker assigned to Alice (see [Entities](entities.md) for how `away` works).

```yaml
alias: "Alice is home"
mode: single
trigger:
  - platform: state
    entity_id: sensor.alice_room
    from: "away"
condition:
  # Ignore glitches to "unknown" or "unavailable"
  - condition: template
    value_template: >
      {{ trigger.to_state.state not in ['away', 'unknown', 'unavailable'] }}
action:
  - service: notify.mobile_app_your_phone   # change to your notify service
    data:
      title: "Welcome home"
      message: >
        Alice just got home and is in the
        {{ trigger.to_state.state | replace('_', ' ') }}.
```

For "Alice left", use `to: "away"` instead and change the message.

!!! warning "Not yet available: `roomer_person_arrived` and related events"
    Roomer defines `roomer_person_arrived`, `roomer_person_left` and `roomer_room_changed` events, but the current version **does not fire them**, so automations that trigger on them never run. Use the room sensor's state, as above, until that is fixed. The planned event fields are listed on [Services & events](services-events.md).

## Example 3: "you've been at your desk too long"

Remind Alice to take a break after two hours in the office without leaving.

```yaml
alias: "Desk break reminder for Alice"
mode: single
trigger:
  - platform: state
    entity_id: binary_sensor.alice_in_office
    to: "on"
    for: "02:00:00"
condition:
  - condition: time
    after: "08:00:00"
    before: "20:00:00"
action:
  - service: notify.mobile_app_alice_phone   # change to Alice's notify service
    data:
      title: "Time for a break"
      message: "You've been in the office for 2 hours. Stand up and stretch!"
```

The two-hour timer starts over whenever `binary_sensor.alice_in_office` drops to `off`, even for one update. If the reminder never arrives, look at the binary sensor's history; brief flips to another room are the usual cause. See [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md).

## More ideas

```yaml
# Pause the living-room TV when nobody is left in the living room
alias: "Pause TV when the living room empties"
mode: restart
trigger:
  - platform: state
    entity_id:
      - binary_sensor.alice_in_living_room
      - binary_sensor.bob_in_living_room
    to: "off"
    for: "00:02:00"
condition:
  - condition: state
    entity_id: binary_sensor.alice_in_living_room
    state: "off"
  - condition: state
    entity_id: binary_sensor.bob_in_living_room
    state: "off"
  - condition: state
    entity_id: media_player.living_room_tv
    state: "playing"
action:
  - service: media_player.media_pause
    target:
      entity_id: media_player.living_room_tv
```

!!! note
    Pausing the TV removes a "media playing" signal from the living room, which can make Roomer place people elsewhere sooner. That is usually what you want, but keep the `for:` delay.

More examples are in [`examples/example_automation.yaml`](https://github.com/owens-ben/roomer/blob/main/examples/example_automation.yaml) on GitHub, including a Bayesian sensor that combines Roomer with a light.

## Blueprints

A blueprint is a ready-made automation where you only fill in a form. Roomer ships four, in the [`blueprints/`](https://github.com/owens-ben/roomer/tree/main/blueprints) folder:

| Blueprint | What it does | Triggers on |
|---|---|---|
| **Roomer - Follow Me Music** | When a person changes rooms with at least the minimum confidence (default `0.7`), pauses the speaker in the old room and plays on the speaker in the new room | A person's room sensor changing room |
| **Roomer - Room-Based Climate Control** | Sets a thermostat to an "occupied" temperature when a person enters a chosen room, and back to an "away" temperature when they leave it | A person's room sensor changing room |
| **Roomer - Welcome Home Lights** | Turns on lights (optionally only after dark) when a person arrives home, then off again after five minutes | A person's room sensor changing from `away` to a room |
| **Roomer - Goodbye Routine** | After a delay, turns off lights, locks doors, sets the thermostat and arms the alarm, if everyone you picked is still away | Any of the chosen room sensors changing from a room to `away` |

All four trigger on the room sensor's state, so they work without the `roomer_person_arrived` / `roomer_person_left` events (which Roomer doesn't fire yet). Only room changes trigger them: updates where just the `confidence` attribute changes are ignored.

Notes on each:

- **Welcome Home Lights** and **Goodbye Routine** depend on `away`, so each person needs a device tracker assigned under **Person Device Ownership** (see [Entities](entities.md)). A change from `away` to `unknown` is not treated as an arrival.
- **Goodbye Routine** takes one or more room sensors. If someone comes back during the delay, or anyone you picked is still home when it ends, nothing happens. The lights, locks, thermostat and alarm are each optional; leaving one empty skips just that step.
- **Follow Me Music**: the speaker that's playing in the old room is a "media playing" signal for that room if it's mapped in Roomer, which holds the person there. Map speakers you use with this blueprint sparingly, or lower **Minimum Confidence** to `0.6` (a single motion sensor in the new room is then enough). Pick values around 0.7; the old advice to lower it to 0.4 dates from an earlier, lower-scoring confidence formula.

!!! note "Upgrading from an earlier version"
    Goodbye Routine's inputs changed (it now asks for **Person Room Sensors**). Re-import the blueprints, then open each automation made from Goodbye Routine, fill in the sensors and save.

### Importing a blueprint

**Option 1: import from the URL**

1. Go to **Settings → Automations & scenes → Blueprints**.
2. Click **Import blueprint**.
3. Paste the blueprint's GitHub URL, for example:

    ```text
    https://github.com/owens-ben/roomer/blob/main/blueprints/follow_me_music.yaml
    ```

    The other files are `room_based_climate.yaml`, `welcome_home_lights.yaml` and `goodbye_routine.yaml`.

4. Click **Preview**, then **Import blueprint**.

**Option 2: copy the files**

1. Copy the `.yaml` files to `/config/blueprints/automation/roomer/`.
2. Go to **Developer Tools → YAML** and click **Automations** under "YAML configuration reloading", or restart Home Assistant.

**Using it:** go to **Settings → Automations & scenes → Create automation**, choose **Create new automation from blueprint**, pick the Roomer blueprint, fill in the inputs (for example **Person Room Sensor** = `sensor.alice_room`) and save.

!!! example "Screenshot needed: blueprint-follow-me-form.png"
    The "Roomer - Follow Me Music" blueprint form filled in: Person Room Sensor set to `sensor.alice_room`, a room-to-speaker mapping, and Minimum Confidence at its default of 0.7.

## Vision identification on camera motion

If you have a camera with person or animal detection, [`automations/vision_on_motion.yaml`](https://github.com/owens-ben/roomer/blob/main/automations/vision_on_motion.yaml) is an example that calls `roomer.identify_person` whenever the camera detects someone. It was written for a specific Reolink camera, so replace every `e1_zoom` entity with your own. Its debounce condition reads the `timestamp` attribute of `sensor.vision_last_identification`, so it doesn't re-run within 30 seconds of the last identification. See [Services & events](services-events.md) for the service fields.
